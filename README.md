#How It Works

Signup Process:
The user fills out the registration form with required details.
Validation ensures the email is unique and the password meets security standards.
After registration, users can log in immediately if their role is a general user; for doctors, admin approval is required.

Login Process:
Users enter their registered email and password.
Credentials are authenticated against the database. If valid, users are granted access and redirected to their dashboard based on their role.
Invalid credentials display an appropriate error message.

Booking Appointments:
Users can search for doctors by specialty or name.
Once a doctor is selected, the user chooses an available slot and confirms the booking.
Payments can be made after confirming the booking.
Role-Based Panels:

Users: Book and manage their appointments. View their payment history and notifications.
Doctors: Manage their schedule, approve/reject appointment requests, and provide feedback.
Admin: Oversee all operations, approve doctors, and monitor user activity.
Razorpay Payment Integration:

After confirming the appointment, the user is redirected to the Razorpay payment gateway.
Payment status is updated in real-time and reflected in the user and doctor dashboards.
